## 📋 Smart Contract Functions

| Function | Access | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `authorizeIssuer()` | Owner Only | Authorize institutions to issue certificates |
| `issueCertificate()` | Authorized Issuers | Issue new certificates with metadata |
| `verifyCertificate()` | Public | Verify certificate authenticity and get details |
| `revokeCertificate()` | Issuer/Owner | Invalidate fraudulent certificates |
| `getTotalCertificates()` | Public | Get total number of issued certificates |

### Usage Example

```solidity
// 1. Deploy contract
CertificateVerification cert = new CertificateVerification();

// 2. Authorize an institution
cert.authorizeIssuer(institutionAddress, "MIT");

// 3. Issue a certificate
uint256 certId = cert.issueCertificate(
    "John Doe",
    "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", 
    "Computer Science",
    "QmHash123..."
);

// 4. Verify certificate
(name, institution, course, hash, date, valid, issuer) = cert.verifyCertificate(certId);
```
